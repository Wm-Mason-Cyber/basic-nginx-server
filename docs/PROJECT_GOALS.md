- Differentiate between secure and insecure web server configurations.
- Configure Nginx to serve a static website.
- Implement essential security headers to protect a website from common attacks.
- Understand the basics of TLS and how to set up a self-signed certificate for local development.
- Use `curl` and other command-line tools to inspect HTTP headers and debug web server issues.
- Understand the importance of caching and compression for web performance.
- Write a simple CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment.
